- **Body Section (`<body>`):**
  - Contains a `div` element with the class `login-container` to structure the login content.

- **Login Form:**
  - The form includes:
    - A heading (`<h2>Login</h2>`).
    - Two input fields for entering the username and password.
    - Labels associated with each input for better accessibility.
    - A submit button with the class `login-button`.

## Usage:
